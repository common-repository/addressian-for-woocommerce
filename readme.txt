Addressian for Woocommerce offers a straightforward and easy way to use Addressian's "address autocomplete" and "postcode to address".

== Description ==

Using this plugin, you can add "address autocomplete" (search-as-you-type) or "postcode to address" to your store's checkout form.

For £30/month or £40/month:

Increase your website's conversion rate, as users are more willing to complete their purchase if they don\'t have to type in their address manually.
All big e-commerce websites enable their user to type in their postcode, press a button and choose their address from a suggestion list. This plugin enables you to have that, or even better provide a way for use to type in a few letters of their address and the plugin autocompletes their address.

Your mobile users especially will love your website's checkout as it's much harder to navigate a checkout form and type in their address. Simplify your checkout now!

Addressian is a UK address and postcode finding service. We specialise in offering a simple to use, lightweight and ultra-fast REST API.

You can choose between two modes: "Address Autocomplete" and "Address Finder by Postcode".

- "Address Finder by Postcode" mode will let the users enter their postcode, press "Find" and the system will provide a list of addresses associated with that postcode. The user can select their address and the plugin will auto-fill their checkout form.
